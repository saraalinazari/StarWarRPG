# StarWarRPG
- I used an object to implement whole game 
- in my game object, I have a collection that keeps all healthpoints, attackpowerseeds , name ,...
- when user first click on characters, she picks her character. Then, the character that user selects
should fight with all other characters.
- After user picks her character, then all other characters will be enemies. 
- user pick one of enemies from options, that enemy will be defender, and start to fight.
- if user loses that defender (that she picked), then she loses and game is over. If she can defeat 
defender, she neds to pick another defender between enemies to fight.
- If user can defeat all enemies one by one, then she wins.
- In each fight, attackpowerseed will increase to attackpower of user character and attackpower will decrease 
defender healthpoint. Also, attackpowerseed of defender will be assign to the counter attack of defender and decrease the user cjaracter healthpoint by counter attack amount.
- To start a game, just pick one character. Then you can see options to pick defender character. Pick one character as defender. then start attack by pushing "attack" button. If you lose, it shows You Lost. If you win, you need to pick another character as defender. After you defeat all  characters, then you win the game and you can start from begining.
